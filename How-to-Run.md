# How to Run the Project

Running this project is straightforward. Follow the steps below to get the server up and running on your local machine.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/defaultusermanan/ai-nitin-manan-001.git
   cd ai-nitin-manan-001
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   Since this project does not require any dependencies, you can directly run the server using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. **Access the Server**
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

## Notes

- Ensure that port `3000` is not being used by another application.
- If you encounter any issues, verify that Node.js is installed correctly by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  This should display the installed Node.js version.
